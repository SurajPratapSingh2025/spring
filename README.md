# Flow of Spring
spring [spring core] --> spring jdbc --> spring mvc --> maven --> springboot [spring dataJPA] --> thymeleaf --> RESTful API --> spring security --> microservices
* Note: spring means "project create from manual configuration" => maven :: allow partially auto configuration through pom.xml [Need to write dependency manually]
* Note: springboot means "project create from "spring starter project" => springboot :: allow fully auto configuration [No Need to Write Dependency]
